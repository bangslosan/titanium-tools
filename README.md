TiTools
==============
	This project is a library for Titatium Appcelerator that solves different common problems and allows to create 
real cross platform applications for iOs/Android. It uses only internal Titanium modules so you don't need to install 
additional native modules.

1. Description
=============================
	In our library we implemented pattern called MVC. It allows us to use controllers to implement common logic on 
all platforms. Also we implemented loader of interface from presets in JSON files so now it is possible to divide 
business logic and GUI.
	In library we implemented loading of prefabs and presets for interface so it is possible to create custom 
widgets like buttons and label. Also now you can use liquid design for Android.
	In addition we added functions to work with date, network and so on that works in the same mode both on iOs and
 Android.
